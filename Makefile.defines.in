# This file is intended to include all common compilation defines for the

# in any external project that is included in the SILC source tree.
#
# Add following to your Makefile.am:
#
# include $(top_srcdir)/Makefile.defines.in
#
# All packages in the SILC source tree that include the Makefile.defines.in
# must also include the following two lines in their configure.in file.

# INCLUDE_DEFINES_INT="include \$(top_srcdir)/Makefile.defines_int"   
# AC_SUBST(INCLUDE_DEFINES_INT)

# (See the Makefile.defines_int.pre for all different definitions but DO NOT
#  directly include that file!)

Compiling SILC Toolkit for Win32
================================

- The MSVC++ 6.0 is required to compile the SILC Toolkit.

- Load the silc.dsw workspace file and build the libsilc and
  libsilcclient libraries.  Both Debug and Release versions can
  be compiled.

- The include/ directory includes all include files from the
  SILC Toolkit.  Use that directory as your include source for
  SILC include files when you are programming new application.
